# Horiseon-SEO-Refactor

##Description

Accessibility is a very important aspect of web development and the focus of our refactoring work for Horiseon. We pride ourselves on taking great care to preserve the functionality of existing code while ensuring that people with disabilities have exceptional access to your website.

##Installation

The process of installing these improvements entails only replacing the existing CSS and HTML provided.

##Usage

Assistive technologies will now function smoothly on the screen. Additionally, you might notice that the web page loads significantly faster than it did before—that is because we reduced the size of your image files in addition to consolidating and semantically streamlining your code.
